title: Converting LaTeX publications to HTML
---

Here is a quick recipe to get started:

- Get [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/), to convert LaTeX to HTML.
Run this command:
{% highlight bash %}
pandoc article.tex -o article.html --bibliography article.bib --mathjax
{% endhighlight %}
- Add `<html>`, `<head>` and `<body>` elements.
- Restore the title of the article (use `<title>` and `<h1>`) and the author names.
- Restore figures. PDF figures can be converted into SVG images with [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org).
- Restore figure captions (you can use `<figcaption>`).
- Restore `\ref -> \label` links (use `<a href="#label">` and `<h2 id="label">`).
- Add a link to [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/):
{% highlight html %}
<script src="mathjax/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML"></script>
{% endhighlight %}
- Include a CSS stylesheet. You can start with [this file](http://victor.chahuneau.fr/pub/mtm12/style.css).

Not that macros declared with `\newcommand` and the `\input` command are not supported by pandoc.

## Optional changes

- Change the level of the headings (e.g., `<h1> -> <h2>`)
- HTML5: Add `<section>` elements, use `<header>` for the title of the article and the author list and `<footer>` for the bibliography and the footnotes.
- You can change the citation style by supplying a file in CSL format to pandoc.

## Future work

- Add links from references in the article to full references in the bibliography.
- In an ideal world, you could write your article directly in Markdown and use pandoc to produce both a LaTeX and an HTML version of it.
